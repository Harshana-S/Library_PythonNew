Comments: If you have a a fixed duration patterns from the discovery phase (time stamps) and you want to search for KNN of these patterns given other pitch sequences. You can use this code. 


Input type: this method works on time series of pitch sequence
Task type: search
patterns input: fixed duration patterns, basically the output of discovery
patterns input type: time stamps of couplets
output type: for each input pattern, it searches for N nearest neighbors and return their time stamps and file indices
